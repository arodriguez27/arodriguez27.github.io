        <p>Namaste! My name is Janice and this is my website. Anyone and everyone with good energy and a positive aura is welcome here. </p>
		<p>I want to tell you a little bit about myself. First, and very importantly, I am a dedicated vegan and animal rights supporter. My favorite ways to spend time including trying out new vegan recipes and visiting animal sanctuaries and connecting with the minds and souls of the animals there. I have also been a practicing Buddhist for two and a half weeks now. I like to meditate and chant in various locations around my apartment in order to rid it of any bad karma and make it what I like to call a “zen zone.” Another big part of my life is fashion and style - fair trade and ethically sourced, of course!</p>
        <p>On this website, I hope to provide lifestyle information and hopefully help to transition people into an alternative, peaceful way of living. I didn’t always used to live this way. I used to harbor lots of negative energy and taint the auras of those around me. It was only when my parents paid for me to go to Japan after high school and I was tripping on a party drug in some temple that I really found myself and discovered what my life path was. I hope that by reading my website and following my advice, others can have this same revelation.</p>
