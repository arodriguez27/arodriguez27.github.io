    	<h2>Veganism</h2>
    	<p>As I mentioned, veganism is a major part of my life. Itâ€™s better for the environment and the soul. Also, ingesting death will lead to bad energy and karma. Going vegan is easy when you have delicious recipes and compassion for sentient beings. Here are some of my favorite recipes for you to try out at home.</p>

    	<h3>Taking Care of Your Plants</h3>
    	<p>Having plants around in your home or apartment is such a great way to bring in life positive energy. Here are some of my tips for keeping your plants feeling healthy, loved, and appreciated.</p>
    	<ol>
 			<li>Make sure to always water your plants and give them loving encouragement so that they grow.</li>
            <li>Singing to them and having them listen to music transfers positive energy, thus making them grow stronger and taller.</li>
        	<li>Plants are living beings and will eagerly absorb knowledge and use it to help them grow. Read to your plants and watch them flourish!</li>
        </ol>
